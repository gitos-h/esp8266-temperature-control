# ESP8266 Temperature Control System

## Overview

This project implements a web-based temperature control system using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It is designed to monitor temperature via a DS18B20 sensor and control a 433 MHz relay switch for heating or cooling. The system features a modern web interface for configuration, automatic/manual relay control, persistent settings, and NTP time synchronization. It is compatible with Home Assistant via MQTT and can be easily integrated into any smart home system.

## Features

- **Temperature Sensing:**  
  Reads temperature from a DS18B20 sensor.

- **Relay Control:**  
  Controls a 433 MHz relay (for heating or cooling) with both automatic (temperature/time-based) and manual modes.

- **Web Interface:**  
  - Modern, responsive interface accessible from any browser.
  - Toggle between Auto and Manual control modes.
  - In Auto mode, relay is controlled by temperature and time schedules.
  - In Manual mode, relay can be toggled directly by the user.
  - Settings for temperature setpoint, delta, frost protection, and on/off schedules.
  - Displays current temperature, relay status, and relay switch history (last ON/OFF times and ON duration).

- **Persistent Settings:**  
  Stores user configuration in EEPROM, minimizing writes to extend EEPROM lifespan.

- **Time Synchronization:**  
  - Synchronizes time with NTP servers.
  - Handles daylight saving time for Berlin timezone.
  - Periodically resynchronizes every 6 hours.

- **WiFi Management:**  
  Uses WiFiManager for easy and secure WiFi setup.

## Code Structure

- **Global Settings & Variables:**  
  Pin assignments, relay protocol, EEPROM size, NTP sync interval, and main variables for temperature, relay status, and user settings.

- **Setup:**  
  - Initializes hardware interfaces and libraries.
  - Loads settings from EEPROM.
  - Sets up WiFi and NTP.
  - Starts the web server and registers HTTP handlers.

- **Loop:**  
  - Handles web server requests.
  - Periodically reads temperature (non-blocking).
  - In Auto mode, executes temperature/time-based relay control.
  - Periodically resynchronizes time with NTP.

- **Web Interface:**  
  - Built dynamically via `buildWebPage()`.
  - Uses modern CSS and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.
  - Displays current status, relay history, and settings forms.
  - Allows toggling between Auto/Manual modes and updating settings.

- **Relay Control:**  
  - `setRelay(bool on)` switches the relay and records ON/OFF times and durations.
  - In Auto mode, relay is controlled by temperature and time logic.
  - In Manual mode, relay is controlled by user input.

- **EEPROM Management:**  
  - Reads and writes settings only when changes are detected to minimize EEPROM wear.

- **Time Handling:**  
  - Uses NTP for accurate timekeeping.
  - Adjusts for daylight saving time.

## Security

- The web interface is currently open and does not require authentication. For security, consider adding password protection if the device is accessible from outside a trusted network.

## Usage

1. **Connect Hardware:**  
   Wire the DS18B20 sensor and 433 MHz transmitter to the ESP8266 as per the pin assignments.

2. **Upload Code:**  
   Flash the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

3. **Connect to WiFi:**  
   On first boot, the device will start in WiFiManager mode. Connect to the ESP8266 AP and configure your WiFi credentials.

4. **Access Web Interface:**  
   Find the ESP8266‚Äôs IP address (shown in serial monitor or router) and open it in your browser.

5. **Configure Settings:**  
   Use the web interface to set temperature setpoints, delta, frost protection, and time schedules. Toggle between Auto and Manual modes as needed.

## Customization

- Adjust pin assignments, relay protocol, and temperature logic as needed for your specific hardware.
- Enhance security by adding authentication to the web interface.
- Extend the UI or backend for additional features such as logging or notifications.
